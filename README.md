# Basic-Portfolio
This is my very first website please do not be to harsh.

Funcionality for this site is to display I have learned in the UCLAEXTENSION FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPEMENT BOOTCAMP. Here is the end result of blending together CSS and HTML to make a desired result. I have made three pretty basic pages that all link to one another and have added some minor content to them. 

The first page is entitled: Portfolio. 
The second page is entitled :About.
The third page is entitled: Contact. 

This also my first attempt at writing a readme.md. 

Here I used HTML to layout the basic frame of the sites. I knew that I would be doing more than one site and the that they all needed to share similiar feautures for a few elements. So with this in mindm, I began to plan my first steps. Headers | main content | footers. I used the HTML header & footer elements to creat these sections and div'd the rest. Once I had the three HTML pages ready to go I linked all three to CSS stylesheet, were the magic began to happen. Well not real magic but for someone who has never coded more than HELLO WORLD !, it was magic for. With the CSS this allowed me to style and place content where I wanted. Allowed me to make backgrounds colored, effect text with either enlarging or bolding or whatever effect I could think of. I used concepts like floats/clear/flexbox/typography and pseudoclass. Psuedo classes allowed for the more "fun" effects, like links chaning colors and the pointer changing structures. Except for blinking, I believe that is more of java script and we are there just yet. 
With CSS in place and all elements placed where desired to match as close to the sample picture provided my first of many great projects was now complete. 

To see the code in your editor : pleae copy the HTTPs link
open your git hub
Toggle to the directory you wish to place the data
use the command in your git command prompt / terminal : git clone (insert HTTPs here) 
press enter
You will amedatley begin to see the data being placed into you specified directory. 
Once the files are in place you will be able to open the editor of your choice and BANG ! there will be all available information/data/documents. 

I hope you enjoy, 

again basic website please be nice.
